<h1 style ="color:blue">Shoes Out of Plastic Pulled From the Ocean</h1>
<p>Popular company is helping clean up the ocean by fishing out plastic 
bottles and using them to make shoes. 
<p> We’ve all heard the warning that there will be more plastic than 
fish in the sea by 2050.

<p>People are working on strategies to remove millions of tons of plastic 
waste from the ocean, but it will end up right back in it if we don’t figure out what to do with it.

<p>Plastic bottles can’t actually be recycled into new plastic bottles, and once plastic is created, it pretty much never goes away.

<p>The company plans to get the ball rolling by making 1 million pairs of running shoes out of 11 million plastic bottles recovered from the ocean, near the Maldives.</p>
