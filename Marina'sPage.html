  <tr>
    <th>Ingredients 
<p> 4 tablespoons ground flax

<p> 1/2 cup + 2 tablespoons water

<p> 2/3 cup vegan butter (earth balance brand), melted *see instructions

<p> 1 cup granulated sugar

<p> 1 cup brown sugar, lightly packed

<p> 1 tablespoon pure vanilla extract

<p> 1 cup all purpose flour

<p> 1 cup unsweetened cocoa powder

<p> 1/2 teaspoon salt

<p> 1 cup non-dairy chocolate chips OR roughly chopped chocolate pieces</th>
    <th>Instructions  
    
<p> Make the flax eggs by stirring the ground flax and water in a small bowl. Set aside to thicken. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F and line a 7 x 11 pan with parchment paper. Melt the vegan butter (earth balance brand preferred), and measure 2/3 cup. I do this by microwaving the vegan butter in a glass measuring cup, in 30 second intervals, until melted.

<p> 1.In a large bowl, whisk the melted vegan butter and sugars together. Add the flax eggs and vanilla, whisk until evenly combined.

<p> 2.Over the same large bowl, sift in the flour and cocoa powder. Add the salt and stir with a large wooden spoon until just combined, do not overmix.

<p> 3.Fold in half of the chocolate chips. Pour the batter into the prepared pan and smooth out the top with a spoon or your hands. Sprinkle the rest of the chocolate chips on top of the batter.

<p>4.Bake for 35-40 minutes, until the middle of the brownies no longer jiggles and is just set.

<p>5.Remove from the oven, allow to cool in the pan for 15 minutes, then pull the brownies out, using the parchment paper and let cool for another 15-30 minutes before slicing and serving.</th>
